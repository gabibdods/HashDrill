# ‚ö° EcoMiner ‚Äî Energy-Efficient CPU Mining Framework (C-based)

EcoMiner is a lightweight, energy-aware mining system written in C, focused on optimizing power consumption across CPUs ‚Äî especially ARM SoCs and low-power devices. Inspired by modern PoW alternatives like **RandomX** and **Chia**, it balances performance, sustainability, and practicality while supporting real-world mining or verification tasks.

## üîç Problem Statement

Traditional mining applications (e.g., Bitcoin‚Äôs SHA-256 miners) are extremely inefficient, wasting enormous amounts of power and hardware resources. There‚Äôs a growing need to:

- Develop **low-power mining alternatives**
- Target **general-purpose CPUs** over energy-hungry GPUs/ASICs
- Explore the use of **low-level hardware optimizations**
- Design for **cross-platform compatibility**, especially ARM

EcoMiner is built to fulfill this niche, enabling efficient, ethical CPU-based mining or validation tasks on desktop and embedded systems.

## üéØ Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Implement an **energy-efficient mining algorithm** (e.g. RandomX or similar)
- ‚úÖ Target low-power CPUs (ARM/x86_64) with **platform-optimized code**
- ‚úÖ Write the miner in **pure C** for maximum control and performance
- ‚úÖ Use **SIMD, cache awareness, and thread affinity** to optimize throughput
- ‚úÖ Allow auto-scaling based on temperature, battery level, and system load
- ‚úÖ Optionally integrate with **green cloud backends** for leaderboards or verification APIs

## üß© Design Decisions

- Used **C** to gain full control over memory usage, threading, and instruction-level performance.
- Prioritized **RandomX-style CPU mining** for its compatibility with low-cost general-purpose processors.
- Focused on **non-GPU computation** to ensure accessibility and reduce power use.
- Added system hooks for **dynamic scaling**, **thermal throttling**, and **idle pausing**.
- Designed the miner to store most data in **RAM** to reduce memory-bound stalls and I/O usage.
